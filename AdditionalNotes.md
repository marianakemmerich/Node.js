#### âœŽ IMPORTANT!

- **I/O** stands for **input/output**, which is stuff like accessing the file system and handling network requests. This is why Node.js is designed around callback functions.

- When using callback functions in our code, that doesn't automatically make it asynchronous.

- Usually, the dot (".") is where the script is running and "__dirname" is where the current file is located.

- Status code 200: stands for "OK", and indicates that the request has succeeded.
