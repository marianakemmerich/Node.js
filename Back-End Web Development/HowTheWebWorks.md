## HOW THE WEB WORKS

- **Request-Response Model** or **Client-Server Architecture** is a synchronous pattern in which the client waits for the response from the server before continuing with other tasks.
This ensures that the client receives the requested information or the result of the task it requested.

- When we open a website, the browser makes a request to a DNS (Domain Name Server), which are special servers where internet domain names are located and translated into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, much like a phonebook. This happens through a Internet Service Provider (ISP).
