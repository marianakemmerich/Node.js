Node.js is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven JavaScript cross-platform runtime environment and library designed to build scalable network applications.

Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.

In this repository you'll find the source codes of the APIs developed throughout the course **Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023** along with some notes of what was studied.
